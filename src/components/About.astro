          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/65">
          Founded in 2010, The Golden Spoon began as a small family dream to
          bring the authentic flavors of Tuscany to our community. Our passion
          for simple, high-quality ingredients and time-honored recipes is at
          the heart of everything we do.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/65">
          We believe in the power of food to bring people together, creating
          memorable experiences one dish at a time. From our handmade pasta to
          our locally sourced produce, every plate tells a story of tradition,
          care, and love for Italian cuisine.
